										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve published the next two sections of the article about the most efficient dish. See <a href="https://efficientplantbasedcooking.com/most-efficient-dish/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You will find that I still haven&#8217;t changed the theme. This is because I&#8217;m not sure whether or not I will continue Efficient Plant-Based Cooking. (I&#8217;m thinking about my future: how I can do the most good and also earn money? Even though I would like to continue Efficient Plant-Based Cooking and have a lot to write about, I might be able to do more good in other ways. See <a href="http://www.effectivealtruism.com/">Doing Good Better</a> and <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide">80000 Hours</a>.) Until I decide whether or not to continue, I at least want to produce as much value as possible. So I&#8217;m focusing on the writing and not on the theme.</p>
<p>That said, I do know that changing to a decent theme would also add value. The current theme looks good (except the green accent colour, which is a crime I committed) and formats the text very readably, but it lacks features that I consider important for Efficient Plant-Based Cooking: search and sign-up fields near the top of the page. So, in order to retain readability and good looks, I will switch to a different theme by the same author, Anders Norén. For lack of time, I won&#8217;t customize it and it might not be as easy to use as I&#8217;d like, but it will have the extra features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In last week&#8217;s update I wrote that I&#8217;m writing a long article.  I found that this article is becoming very long, so I decided to publish it piece by piece. – Just as a blogger would write a series of blog posts about a large subject. – Check out the start of it <a href="https://efficientplantbasedcooking.com/most-efficient-dish/">here</a>. As I note at the end of the article, I will publish the next two sections next week.</p>
<p>You will notice that I haven&#8217;t switched the theme yet, so the site is as clumsy as ever. This is because I&#8217;m having a hard time finding a good theme. Anyway, I think I have decided now, so a new theme should be up by next week. Then I can continue to improve the usability of the site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Efficient Plant-based Cooking now has one <a href="https://efficientplantbasedcooking.com/miso-sandwich/">new recipe</a> as well as one piece of advice and two recipes taken over from my home page; enough to call it launched. Many technical things are not yet as they should be, so I&#8217;ll be improving those. What matters more is the content. I&#8217;ll be posting one new recipe or piece of advice every Wednesday by 18:00 JST and I&#8217;ll write a short post here for every such content update. This means, you can expect the next post on 21 September. Soon you&#8217;ll be able to subscribe to updates, too.</p>
